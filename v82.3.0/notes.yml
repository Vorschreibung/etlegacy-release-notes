      ETLTV now supports LUA alongside with many other improvements.  
      [See the full changelog here](https://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy-docs/edit/master/etltv.rst)

      It has been successfully used to broadcast [Nations Cup 2024](https://www.gamestv.org/league/1755-et-legacy-nations-cup-2024/) matches.

      (A **huge** thanks to Ryzyk for his amazing efforts on these matters!)
  - t: Added new 'video-pipe' command to pipe game footage to ffmpeg
    dt: |
       Pipes game footage to ffmpeg for video recording. 

       If ffmpeg isn't part of your PATH environment variable, the executable must be placed next to the etl binary.

    t: Fix Flamethrower damage being dependent on 'sv_fps'
    p: high
    dt: |
      Flamethrower damage was previously dependent on 'sv_fps' and would cause massively more damage beyond 'sv_fps 20'.

      This is now fixed by making the Flamethrower damage independent of 'sv_fps'.

    t: Smoke Bomb puffs are now deterministic
    p: high
    dt: |
      Smoke from the Smoke Bomb of Covert Ops would previously flow into random directions on each client, causing situations where the view would be blocked for one client, but not blocked for another client.

      This is now fixed by making Smoke from the Smoke Bomb deterministic and thus equal among all clients.

    t: Medic's passive heal is now deterministic
    dt: |
      Medics at full health would previously have a random 0-1 second delay before receiving their first passive heal tick.

      They now always receive their first passive heal tick after exactly 1 second, making it deterministic.
  - c: 5d6514ad7212cedf03a16483a70653328fd5881d
    t: Diagonal medpack/ammopack throws are now possible without immediate self-pickup
    dt: |
      Medics and Field Ops would previously automatically pick up their packs when they throw it at a 45Â° Angle around them.

      This is now fixed by improved pickup collision detection.

    t: MG42/Browning automatically attempts to prone on 'weapalt'
    dt: |
      MG42/Browning would previously require proning manually before they could be deployed.

      In order to bypass the need for this extra key action, which could've already been automated by a user binding, deploying an MG42/Browning now automatically tries to prone before deployment, saving a keystroke by default, similar to mortar.
    oo: 'set `cg_weapAltMgAutoProne` to `0` (default: `1`)'

    t: Play 'noAmmoSound' when trying to switch to an empty weapon
    dt: |
      Attempting to switch to a weapon which is out of ammo would previously fail without any sound or visual cue.

      The 'noAmmoSound' is now being played as a sound cue.
    oo: 'set `cg_weapSwitchNoAmmoSounds` to `0` (default: `1`)'

    t: Disambiguate weapon bank collisions
    dt: |
      This change disambiguates some weapon bank collisions:

      - A Soldier with SMG Perk having both an SMG and a heavy weapon.

        For such cases '2' will now select the SMG, '3' will select the
        heavy weapon.

      - A Soldier with SMG Perk having 2 SMGs

        For such cases '2' will now select your team's SMG, '3' will select
        the other team's SMG.
    oo: 'set `cg_weapBankCollisions` to `1` (default: `0`)'

    t: 'Fixed gunFovOffset regression and add ETL Dynamic Fov Offset'
    p: high
    dt: |
      We introduced a regression in a previous release, where first person weapon models accidentally ended up being put too low in relation to the player view.

      We have fixed this regression and introduced a new default ETL Dynamic Fov Offset feature, which now ships defaults that aim to have consistent gun offsets across different 'cg_fov' values.

      These new defaults also aim to ship good default first person weapon visibility and consistency between the same weapon kinds of the 2 teams, while staying true to the original weapon look.  
      (e.g. the MP40 now should roughly occupy the same screenspace as the Thompson when reloading)

      This also brings back guns, like the Panzerfaust, more to the forefront when it was accidentally previously cut short, without significantly obstructing visibility.
    oo: 'set `cg_gunFov` to `75` to keep `2.82.1` behavior, or to `90` to go even further back to Vanilla ET behavior (default: `0`)'
  - c: a52a594e1856271088b184841c7b6eba21f028d8
    t: Tweaked Character Animations
    dt: |
      Character animations have been slightly tweaked and reframed, to better represent playerstate and playeractions and to increase visibility in some instances.

      Death animations have been revamped to allow better visibility.

      Reload animations now better fit the weapon reload duration.

      Jump animations now are able to support animation transition, when they didn't before.

      Deploying/Undeploying an MG42 now plays a character animation.

      Firing animations don't persist despite the player having stopped firing.

      Alongside other small changes.
  - c: 1ecd6282a1987772748f91a6dbf10bbf8ab6dede
    t: Player Float Sprites now follow heads when downed
    dt: |
      Player float sprites, like the revive icon that Medics see for their teammates, now track the head position instead of being placed immediately at a fixed height, which would clip inside the body during the first half of the death animation.

      This new feature does not affect hitboxes and is purely visual.
    oo: 'set `cg_spritesFollowHeads` to `0` (default: `1`)'
  - c: ???
    t: Tweaked First-Person Weapons
    dt: |
      Weapon animations have been reframed to more accurately reflect the duration of the weaponstate in instances where animations like reload would be interrupted or transition to soon to the IDLE animation despite still reloading.

      Weapon parts have been realigned to reduce graphical glitches, where parts would hover or flick around the screen due to unclean animation frames.

      In some instances models like hands were extended to not reveal clipped length at widescreen or higher 'cg_fovs'.
  - c: 69af71b050b3759f6b95ef646d58785b92470dab
    t: Tweak muzzle flash sizes
    dt: |
      Muzzles flashes have been frequently completely disabled (via 'cg_muzzleFlash 0') in the past, as they have been shipped dramatically oversized with little transparency and thus heavily obstructed visibility.

      We now ship a revamped set of default values with much improved visibility so that players are not incentivized to disable them in order to gain an advantage.
    oo: 'set `cg_muzzleFlashOld` to `1` (default: `0`)'
  - c: 78d5775690cbe4b8c60c159143279f3b9c11d717
    t: Changed 'Geometric Detail' from 'r_lodbias' to 'r_lodscale'
    dt: |
      The 'Geometric Detail' menu option previously made little difference and on highest option still caused needless polygon pop-in on character models

      The underlying CVAR has been changed to better reflect the available options.
  - c: ece71b77ccb147fa7cad1f61ad9fbe788bd1ea8c
    t: Move drawing airplanes into new 'cg_drawAirstrikePlanes'
    p: low
    dt: |
      Drawing airplanes used to be part of `cg_visualEffects`, which however
      has been forced off on many servers due to how visuall obtrusive and fps
      dependent/uneven especially smoke effects are.

      Airplanes were added behind `cg_visualEffects` and got thus practically
      disabled by default.

      However, as they are unobtrusive, practically free from a performance
      stnadpoint and even provide some historic info on where airstrikes
      previously happened, they are now split into a separate CVAR so that
      servers can decide to keep them while still getting rid of the particle
      effects of `cg_visualEffects`.
    oo: 'set `cg_drawAirstrikePlanes` to `0` (default: `1`)'

    t: Added Sharp Custom Crosshairs
    dt: |
      A new set of "vectorized"/sharp crosshairs have been added.

      They replace previous crosshair implementations via 'cg_customCrosshair 1-4' and are configurable via a set of 'cg_customCrosshair*' CVARs.

      Depending on player feedback, we plan to further improve them and to eventually wrap a Crosshair Editor around them in the future.

    t: New HUD 'chargebar'/'healthbar' needle
    dt: |
      Both 'chargebar' and 'healthbar' gained a new needle indicator.

      For 'chargebar' the needle indicates how much of the bar will be consumed by a given weapon.

      For 'healthbar' the needle indicates the HP bonus that is granted from the amount of medics in your team.

    t: Class Limbo Selection now requires confirmation
    dt: |
      Selecting a class in the Limbo menu would previously automatically confirm the loadout.

      In order to be able to look up the availability of weapons (e.g. Panzerfaust) without automatically switching to the class, selecting a class now only takes effect when the loadout is confimed via `OK` (or one of the new Limbo hotkeys: `y`/`z`/`Enter`).

      * `t`               - hotkey toggles showing only the focused component
      * `v`               - hotkey toggles visibility of focused component
      * `alt + mwheel`    - changes scale/text size instead of component size
      * `alt + shift + v` - sets all components visible

      Also move the help text more upwards, as it starts to run the risk of
      going out of bounds when fullscreening.
