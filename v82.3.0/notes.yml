    t: Smoke Bomb puff direction is deterministic
    p: high
    dt: |
      Smoke from the Smoke Bomb of Covert Ops would previously flow into random directions on each client, causing situations where the view would be blocked for one client, but not blocked for another client.

      This is now fixed by making Smoke from the Smoke Bomb deterministic and thus equal among all clients.

    t: Fix Flamethrower damage being dependent on `sv_fps`
    p: high
    dt: |
      Flamethrower damage was previously dependent on `sv_fps` and would cause massively more damage beyond `sv_fps 20`.

      This is now fixed by making the Flamethrower damage independent of `sv_fps`.

    t: Medic's passive heal is now deterministic (eliminates a 0-1 second random factor)
    dt: |
      Medics at full health would previously have a random 0-1 second delay before receiving their first passive heal tick.

      They now always receive their first passive heal tick after exactly 1 second, making it deterministic.

    t: Diagonal medpack/ammopack throws are now possible without immediate self-pickup
    dt: |
      Medics and Field Ops would previously automatically pick up their packs when they throw it at a 45Â° Angle around them.

      This is now fixed by improved pickup collision detection.

    # p: high
    oo: 'set `cg_weapAltMgAutoProne` to `0` (default: `1`)'
    dt: |
      MG42/Browning would previously require proning manually before they could be deployed.

      In order to bypass the need for this extra key action, which could've already been automated by a user binding, deploying an MG42/Browning now automatically tries to prone before deployment, saving a keystroke by default, similar to mortar.

    t: New `cg_muzzleFlashScale` defaults to slightly reduced muzzle flashes
    oo: 'set `cg_muzzleFlashScale` to `1.0` (default: `0.8`)'
    dt: |
      Muzzle flashes have been deemed a visiblity problem for a long time and `cg_muzzleFlash 0` was added a long time ago to allow disabling them altogether.

      In order to give players more options for better visibility without giving up on game aesthetics altogether, `cg_muzzleFlashScale` is introduced to give players an option to tune them down to their own liking.

      This new CVAR defaults to `0.8` to give a better default experience and caps between `0.5` and `1.0`.

    t: New `cg_muzzleFlashDlight` to force muzzle flash dynamic light independent of `cg_muzzleFlash`
    dt: |
      The new `cg_muzzleFlashDlight` allows players to force the dynamic light of muzzles flashes on or off independent of `cg_muzzleFlash` has been set.

      This allows for example to have the dynamic light of muzzle flashes, without the muzzle flashes themselves.

      *Supported values*:
        `0` - depend on `cg_muzzleFlash` (default)
        `1` - force muzzle flash dynamic light off
        `2` - force muzzle flash dynamic light on
